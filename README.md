Hi! I forked this repository to write my own toolset to deal with openscad. Its a good system - but..
# Running
npm install && npm run dev


**OpenSCAD** is an amazing software for creating solid 3D CAD objects, but modeling with the **OpenSCAD** language can be really cumbersome and limited. **scad-js** is a transpiler layer to avoid this pain

## Getting started
First make sure you have [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) installed on your system, we will use it to visualize the model.
