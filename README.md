Hi! I forked this repository to write my own toolset to deal with openscad. Its a good system - but..

## Running
npm install && npm run dev
This will run the code in index.js on save. I've got shapes saved in ./shapes
No documentation. Just read the code!

## Requirements
You need to have openscad installed, as well as https://github.com/Irev-Dev/Round-Anything/

# About
**OpenSCAD** is an amazing software for creating solid 3D CAD objects, but modeling with the **OpenSCAD** language can be really cumbersome and limited. **scad-js** is a transpiler layer to avoid this pain
